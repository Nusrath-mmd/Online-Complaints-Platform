Project Overview: Online Platform Complaints System
Project Title:
Online Platform Complaints Management System

Objective:
To design and implement an online system that enables users to file, track, and resolve complaints against digital platforms (e.g., e-commerce, social media, streaming services) in a transparent and efficient manner.

Ability to attach screenshots, videos, or documents.
